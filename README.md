# Quantum Chess

## Overview

For my final project, I have created QuantumChess, a brand new spin on chess that incorporates QIS principles. The educational aim of the game is to teach people to think about measurement and entanglement in the context of chess.

## Game Rules

The game works like normal chess, except each player controls two boards, which are “entangled”. Each turn, a player will make a move on the board they have not most recently played on. When a player captures a piece, this is a “measurement” of that pieces location, and the corresponding piece on the other board, the “entangled state”, also disappears.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objective of this project is for students to understand two things:
The collapse of a quantum superposition upon measurement. In the context of the game, this is represented by the capturing of pieces.
Quantum entanglement. Here, when we measure one piece by capturing it, the corresponding entangled pair on the second board is also captured.

## Defining the User

The intended audience is novice non-technical learners. Specifically, children around middle school age who are looking to get started thinking computationally in a quantum manner. Playing the game requires background knowledge of the basic rules of chess.

Bryan Zhang is a rising 6th grader from Sunnyvale, CA. He is interested in computer programming and would like to explore emerging fields. 


### Malcolm Rogers from Sunnyvale, CA

Malcolm Rogers is a double amputee from Ann Arbor Michigan. He lost his arms in a tragic hockey accident when he was run over by a Zamboni. However, he hasn’t let that stop him from pursuing STEM.

## Defining the Facilitator

## Educational Setting

Ideally this could be introduced as a chess variant, taught at chess clubs around the country. Chess stimulates parts of the brain that are useful for classical computational thinking: thinking about moves in a sequential order, performing calculations, and thinking strategically. I hope to incorporate thinking about measurement and quantum entanglement as well. That way, when students go in for more advanced quantum computing topics later on in life, they are well prepared in intuitively visualizing superpositions.
