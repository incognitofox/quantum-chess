## Overview

For my final project, I have created Quantum Chess, a brand new spin on chess that incorporates QIS principles. The educational aim of the game is to teach people to think about measurement and entanglement in the context of chess.

The game works like normal chess, except each player controls two boards, which are “entangled”. Each turn, a player will make a move on the board they have not most recently played on. When a player captures a piece, this is a “measurement” of that piece's location, and the corresponding piece on the other board, the “entangled state”, also disappears.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objective of this project is for students to understand two things:
1. The collapse of a quantum superposition upon measurement. In the context of the game, this is represented by the capturing of pieces.
2. Quantum entanglement. Here, when we measure one piece by capturing it, the corresponding entangled pair on the second board is also captured. In other words, by measuring one piece, we can infer properties about its entangled pair.

## Defining the User

The intended audience is novice non-technical learners. Specifically, children around middle school age who are looking to get started thinking computationally in a quantum manner. Playing the game requires background knowledge of the basic rules of chess.

### Bryan from Sunnyvale, CA

Bryan is a rising 6th grader from Sunnyvale, CA. He is interested in computer programming and would like to explore emerging fields. Byran has a background in competitive chess, and was introduced to Quantum Chess at a local chess club. Through the game, he is able to gain valuable insights about the principle of quantum entanglement, and the loss of quantum information from measurement.


### Sarah from Chicago, IL

Sarah has just started highschool in Chicago, IL. An older sibling introduced her to Quantum Chess. She isn’t very interested in STEM fields, but enjoys playing with her siblings. The exposure to quantum information sciences helps her bring quantum thinking to things she is interested in. Sarah is writing a science fiction piece for her schools literary magazine, and hopes to use some of the information she has learned from playing the game.

### James from New York

James is a 7th grader from New York. A teacher had him play the game during a science class at school. He thought it was fun, but probably won’t play it again outside of class. He does however develop an understanding that quantum particles lose quantum properties when measured, and that one can infer the states of an entangled pair from only one measurement. These ideas interest him, particularly the implication that with entanglement, one can theoretically communicate across very long distances.



## Defining the Facilitator

### Grace, a school teacher

Grace is a 7th grade science teacher. She is teaching a unit on atomic models and wants to expose her students to new developments in quantum information sciences, without going into advanced mathematics which she knows will bore her students. She is familiar with the standard example of Schroedingers cat, but finds the thought experiment difficult to grasp for her students, and a bit contrived. Through Quantum Chess, she can provide a more salient example with clear results. Most of her students are familiar with the game of chess.

## Educational Setting

Ideally this could be introduced as a chess variant, taught at chess clubs around the country. Chess stimulates parts of the brain that are useful for classical computational thinking: thinking about moves in a sequential order, performing calculations, and thinking strategically. I hope to incorporate thinking about measurement and quantum entanglement as well. That way, when students go in for more advanced quantum computing topics later on in life, they are well prepared in intuitively visualizing measurement and entanglement.
